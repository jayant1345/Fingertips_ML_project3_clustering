# 🧠 Fingertips Project 3 – Clustering Analysis

This repository contains a clustering analysis project using public health data from [Fingertips (Public Health England)](https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/). The objective of this project is to explore patterns in health indicators across different local authorities using unsupervised machine learning techniques.

## 📌 Project Overview

- 🧹 Data preprocessing and cleaning
- 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- 📊 Dimensionality Reduction (PCA, t-SNE)
- 📈 Clustering techniques (KMeans, Hierarchical, DBSCAN)
- 🧪 Evaluation of clustering results
- 📉 Visualizations of clusters and their health profiles

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure Python 3.7+ is installed. Recommended to use a virtual environment.

### Installation Steps

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/fingertips-clustering.git
cd fingertips-clustering

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

Tip: If requirements.txt does not exist, run pip freeze > requirements.txt after installing libraries used in the notebook.
📦 Libraries Used
pandas

numpy

scikit-learn

matplotlib

seaborn

plotly

scipy

📊 Methods Applied
KMeans Clustering

Hierarchical Clustering (Agglomerative)

DBSCAN

PCA for dimensionality reduction

Silhouette Score, Elbow Method, Dendrograms for model evaluation

t-SNE for 2D visualization of high-dimensional data

📈 Results Summary
Visualized distinct health clusters using PCA and t-SNE

Identified similar local authorities based on public health indicators

Compared clustering models using silhouette scores and dendrogram structures

Would you like me to:

- Auto-generate a `requirements.txt` from the notebook?
- Add badges or a preview GIF of the cluster plots?
- Bundle this in a ZIP file for immediate sharing or upload?

Let me know and I can prepare it for you.
